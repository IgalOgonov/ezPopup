# ezPopup
A simple VanillaJS plugin to create popups (mainly - hover-over popups)

Basically, used to replace the jQuery hover-over popup, but can actually do a bit more.  
Currently selects elements by ID, but will probably be extended to select using document.QuerySelector (and work on the first selection).

Example over at [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/s3e6xy4c/)
